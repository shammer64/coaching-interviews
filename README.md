## Tire Pressure Monitoring System Kata

* Write the unit tests for the Alarm class. 
* The Alarm class is designed to monitor tire pressure and set an alarm if the pressure falls outside of the expected range. 
* The Sensor class provided for the exercise fakes the behaviour of a real tire sensor, providing random but realistic values. 
* Note that there is a MockAlarm and a StubAlarm class provided in the "tests" folder. The purpose of these is purely to demonstrate how a mock and a stub look, you won't need them to complete the exercise.
