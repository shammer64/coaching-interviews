## Tire Pressure Monitoring System Kata

* Write the unit tests for the Alarm class. 
* The Alarm class is designed to monitor tire pressure and set an alarm if the pressure falls outside of the expected range. 
* The VirtualSensor class provided for the exercise fakes the behavior of a real tire sensor, providing random but realistic values.
